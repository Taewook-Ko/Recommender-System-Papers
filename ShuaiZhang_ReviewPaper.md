- 80 percent of movies watched on Netflix came from recommendations [43]
- 60 percent of video clicks came from home page recommendation in YouTube [30]
- presented a deep neural network based recommendation algorithm for video recommendation on YouTube [27] 
- App recommender system for Google Play with a wide & deep model [20]

## DL techniques
- MLP / AutoEncoder / CNN / RNN / LSTM / RBM / 
- Neural AutoRegressive Distribution Estimation
- Adverserial Networks
- Attention Models
- Deep RL

### Why Deep Learning?
- Nonlinear Transformation
- Representation Learning
- Sequence Modeling

### Petential Limitation
- Interpretability
- Data Requirement
- Extensive Hyper-param Tuning

# Summuraize
## MLP based RS
### 1. Neural Extention of Traditional Recomm Method
### 2. Feature Representation Learning with MLP
### 3. Recomm with Deep Structured Semantic Model
